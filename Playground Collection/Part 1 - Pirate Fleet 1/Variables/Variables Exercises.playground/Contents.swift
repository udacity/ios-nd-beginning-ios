//: ## Variables Exercises
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
### Exercise 1

For each of the following names and types, create a variables or constant that best represents it:

- boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius (Double)
- gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
- naturalLogarithmicBase (Double)
- ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
- studentNickname (String)
*/

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
let gallonsRemainingInTank = "2"
let ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32.45
let _numberOfGasIcons = Int(gallonsRemainingInTank)
var numberOfPolygonsInModel = 30
numberOfPolygonsInModel = 32
var polygonsLeftToDraw = 0
polygonsLeftToDraw = numberOfPolygonsInModel

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to invalid names:
var nameOfSchool = "Udacity"
var classSubject = "Math"
let _import = "Nissian"
var 🐩myDog = "🐶"
var 🐕yourDog = "🐶"
