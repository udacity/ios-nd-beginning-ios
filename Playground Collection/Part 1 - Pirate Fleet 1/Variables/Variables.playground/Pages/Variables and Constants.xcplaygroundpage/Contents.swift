## Variables and Constants
Closely related to variables are constants. Constants can be summarized with the following phrase, “if a value does not change, then it is constant”.

**To create a constant, use either of the following syntaxes:**

*let nameOfConstant = constantValue*

*let nameOfConstant: Type = constantValue*

let piConstant = 3.14
